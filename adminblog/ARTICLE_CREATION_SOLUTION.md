## 🚀 How to Test Article Creation

### Method 1: Using the Admin Panel (Recommended)
1. **Start the server**: Make sure `npm run dev` is running on port 4322

   - Category: Select from dropdown (should now be populated)
   - Content: Write your article content
   - Excerpt: Brief description
   - Upload an image (optional)
4. **Submit**: Click "Save as Draft" or "Publish"

### Method 2: Using API Directly
```bash
# Test with curl (replace localhost:4322 with your server)
curl -X POST http://localhost:4322/api/articles \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "title": "API Test Article",
    "content": "This article was created via API",
    "excerpt": "API test excerpt",
    "category": "BDSM",
    "status": "draft"
  }'
```

### Method 3: Using the Test Script
```bash
node test-article-creation.js
```
